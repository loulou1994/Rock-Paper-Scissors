## My process

- Built Up the markup first into separate React components
- Styled the page using the sass css preprocessor
- Wrote the js logic and getting help sometimes to some similar achieved works on the github repos
- Debugging the code through the console log and React's dev tool chrome extension

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project was a huge boost for me in my journey to learn React. I got introduced to the useContext hook and further got better at useEffect's convenient use cases.

### Continued development

I plan on continuing to learn React's advanced concepts, namely: Routing, useReducer, and custom hooks...so on

### Useful resources

- [My best friend](https://www.google.com) - Not just in tech worl.
- [StackOverflow](https://www.stackOverflow.com) - I once was stuck in a logic side part where js strictcMode behaviour was weird and threw an error. I found the reason why by reading through a couple of stackOverflow topics' issues.

I'm particularly thankful to one github repo which helped me come up with a slight logic piece solution.
